1. Area of a triangle when it's three vertices are given:
Area = ½ |x₁(y₂ – y₃) + x₂(y₃ – y₁) + x₃(y₁ – y₂)|
Area = 1/2 ​∣(x2​−x1​)(y3​−y1​)−(x3​−x1​)(y2​−y1​)∣    # Subtracting the first vertex coordinates from the rest

2. a.) Rounding Down to the Nearest Multiple of K:
This technique is called Floor Rounding. It finds the largest multiple of K that is less than or equal to the original number.
The Formula:
Rounded Value=(Original Value//K)×K

b.) Rounding Up to the Nearest Multiple of K:
This technique is called Ceiling Rounding. It finds the smallest multiple of K that is greater than or equal to the original number.
The Formula:
Rounded Value=((Original Value+(K−1))//K)×K
This formula uses the K−1 offset to "push" the number just past the boundary, forcing the integer division to count one more full interval. (The original time formula used K=5, so the offset was 5−1=4).

3. The divmod() Function
The Python built-in function divmod(a, b) is a powerful and efficient way to perform both integer division and calculate the remainder in a single operation.

It takes two numbers, a and b, and returns a tuple containing two values:
divmod(a,b)=(⌊a/b⌋,a(modb))
- The first element is the quotient (the result of the floor division, a//b).
- The second element is the remainder (the result of the modulo operation, a%b).

Use Case in the Code:
In the given code, divmod is used to convert a large number of minutes into hours and minutes, since there are 60 minutes in an hour.
Example: If s=455 minutes:
divmod(455,60)=(7,35)
This means 455 minutes is 7 full hours and 35 remaining minutes (i.e., 07:35).
