1. Bitwise Operator XOR:
x ^ x = 0
x ^ 0 = 1
Uses: a.) Swapping variables without creating a temp variable.
      b.) Finding unique value.

2. Flattening a 2-D matrix:
matrix = 2-D matrix
flat_list = [item for row in matrix for item in row]

3. Transpose of a 2-D matrix:
transposed = [[row[i] for row in matrix] for i in range(number of columns of matrix)]
